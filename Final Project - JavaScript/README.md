![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps
Create a Web Page shopping Cart using Vue

1) Create a wireframe of how I want the page to look. 

2) Set up a skeleton HTML page to work with

3) Set up a div to start using vue
	- Place it in the correct spot.
	
4)  Make sure the functionallity works correctly

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

Used an HTML, CSS, and Javascript file for this Project, along with Vue framework.  

```

```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Design the web page based on wireframe.

```
Each product has it's own space.

```
Make sure functionallity of each item works.  
```
Each item doesn't affect other items and the out of stock works great.  A final price is also listed.  

```

## Notes

Had issues with one item per row.  I didn't want the web page to display vertically but It was an issue with how I set vue up.
