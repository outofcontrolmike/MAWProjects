![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

Figure out how to create Rock Paper Scissors in PHP.

1. Determine varibles to be used for information storing
2. Figure out how to keep track of increments using php (since there's no DOM invovled)
3. Write out game logic
4. Figure out over all design

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
I used built in classes through Fomantic UI, which is different than using a normal class to create an OOP object.
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Make sure increments work and the logic makes sense to user
```
Records are incremented for every win/ loss scenario and the correct images show.
```

Error handling 

```
The only thing I can think of is someone could inspect the page and find the hidden input fields that keep track of the wins and losses.
```

## Notes
