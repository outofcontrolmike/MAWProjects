            <p>I am currently studying Computer Information Science at a Community College in Springfield Missouri that's named 
                Ozark's Technical Community College.  I am planning to obtain my Associate's Degree in Computer Information Science this Fall(2019)</p>
                <p>
                    I currently work at this campus, engaging in a work study position for Web Services.  I assist with various projects that
                    the college's website needs. Previous to this position I haven't had exposure to the computer science field besides classes.
                    I can say I've had plenty of exposure to different programming languages, and I still have a lot to learn.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have three Microsoft Certifications from this campus in the following areas;
                
                    <li>MTA Introduction to HTML & CSS</li>
                    <li>MTA Introduction to Javascript Programming</li>
                    <li>MTA Database Fundamentals SQL Programming</li>
