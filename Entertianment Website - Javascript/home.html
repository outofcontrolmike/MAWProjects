                <h2>Welcome to Michael Wilson's Portfolio</h2>
               
            <p>I am currently studying Computer Information Science at a Community College in Springfield Missouri that's named 
                Ozark's Technical Community College.  I am planning to obtain my Associate's Degree in Computer Information Science this Fall(2019)</p>
                <p>
                    I currently work at this campus, engaging in a work study position for Web Services.  I assist with various projects that
                    the college's website needs. Previous to this position I haven't had exposure to the computer science field besides classes.
                    I can say I've had plenty of exposure to different programming languages, and I still have a lot to learn.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next few years I would like to be working in the software development field or possibly even
                    the network security field.  I would also like to branch more into some game development, maybe use a 
                    game engine such as Unity.  I am eager to see where I'll fit in best.  
                </p>

                    I have three Microsoft Certifications from this campus in the following areas;
