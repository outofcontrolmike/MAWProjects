        <h2>Welcome to Michael Wilson's Portfolio</h2>

        <p>I am currently studying Computer Information Science at a Community College in Springfield Missouri that's
            named
            Ozark's Technical Community College. I am planning to obtain my Associate's Degree in Computer Information
            Science this Fall(2019)</p>
        <p>
            I currently work at this campus, engaging in a work study position for Web Services. I assist with various
            projects that
            the college's website needs. Previous to this position I haven't had exposure to the computer science field
            besides classes.
            I can say I've had plenty of exposure to different programming languages, and I still have a lot to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next few years I would like to be working in the software development field or possibly even
            the network security field. I would also like to branch more into some game development, maybe use a
            game engine such as Unity. I am eager to see where I'll fit in best.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have three Microsoft Certifications from this campus in the following areas;
