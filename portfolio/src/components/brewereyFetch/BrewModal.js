<h3>Basic Searching</h3>

<h3>Basic Filtering</h3>
<p id="brewP">
 You have the options to filter by Name, City or Zipcode on the first select dropdown menu.  Once you select the filter you want, you'll want to type in the search value.

<h3>State Filtering</h3>
<p id="brewP">You can easily choose any state and submit a search based on your choice. Keep in mind that You won't be able to see every brewery in each state since we're limited to 50 items per request. *Adding multiple pages will be a stretch goal later on*</p>

<h3>Bonus Notes</h3>
