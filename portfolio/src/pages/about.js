            I am a person that is always trying to learn new skills and enjoy
            the process at the same time. I believe there is nothing better than
            working on a passion project. I have been involved with Web
            Development and Programming since the Spring of 2018.

            I originally gained interest for Web development during a previous
            job I had, managing an online vitamin store through WooCommerce. I
            found it interesting to use tools through wordpress to alter the
            front end of my company's website.

            Other than coding, I really love hiking, traveling and trying a
            variety of new things. I also enjoy playing guitar, writing and
            photography. I am married and we have two pet dogs, which we all
            share a house that's over 100 years old.
