            I am a person that is always trying to learn new skills and enjoy
            the process at the same time. I believe there is nothing better than
            working on a passion project. I have been involved with Web
            Development and Programming since the Spring of 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally gained interest for Web development during a previous
            job I had, managing an online vitamin store through WooCommerce. I
            found it interesting to use tools through wordpress to alter the
            front end of my company's website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I work with the Javascript coding language, specifically
            in the{" "}
            <span>
              {" "}
              <a
                style={{ fontSize: "large", color: "gold" }}
                target="_blank"
                href="https://reactjs.org/"
              >
                React JS Library.
              </a>
            </span>{" "}
            My tasks include fixing bugs and implementing feature requests among
            a few of my companies projects built with react.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my free time I attempt to build projects with React so I can
            have more to offer every new day at work. I generally like to mess
            around with API's and display information that's interesting to the
            public and myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than coding, I really love hiking, traveling and trying a
            variety of new things. I also enjoy playing guitar, writing and
            photography. I have a fiance and two pet dogs and we all share a
            house that's over 100 years old.
