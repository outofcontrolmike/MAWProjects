# The Great Race

This program is meant to show knowledge of Javascript and CSS (Hide, Show, position properties).  
It's literally Mario and Yoshi racing randomly based On click events of a star.  

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps
Create a Racing game between 2 or more characters, use Javascript for some manipulation of HTML and CSS properties

2) Create the design of the race, basically a wireframe
3) Work on the actual game Logic;
    * When a user clicks on the star, Hide the standing images and show Racing images
    * When a character reaches the end, they will display in the middle of the screen (Hide the racers, Show standing image in new position).
    * When user clicks winning image, standing characters to left show along with star turning back to black.
    * Function will call the whole other function to replay the game without browser reload.

4) make sure to keep all images in the same folder as code files

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

Since this was Javascript I didn't use classes.  I know there is a way to implement classes in in Javascript... I figured making different Javascript files might be another method.

```

```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Design the look and logic of the race.

```
Everything's placed and showing/hiding based on click events.

```
Make sure Race actually works
```
Race stops and the character that's fastest does win.  Clicking the Winning character does work and the race can be reset correctly.  

```

## Notes

Explain any issues or testing instructions.

There is issues if you use a screen that's bigger or smaller than what I used.  The positioning is incorrect but could be an easy fix with some understanding.
